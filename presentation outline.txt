Tesla! Today I will be discussing about the Tesla motor company 
by not discussing about Tesla motor company.

*show Tesla accelerating

Tesla not light, contains mondern amenities and carries a bank of li ion
and still does 0-60mph in 2.3s

Impressive and considerate

A new challenger appears
*show dodge challenger

*show Aventador accelerating

only does 0-60mph in 2.7s

in the racing world 4 tenths is an awfully long time

e-motor clinically quick
ice fast and furious.

//So where am I going with this.
//that speed alone does not make a car feel special. //IE high speed rail.

Ok that was a bit unfair.
Of course an electric motor would always be significantly quieter than a roaring v12.
Presentors bias

For those following the F1 2017 season
F1 2017 challengers 1.6 liter V6 + 160BHP e-motor 

*show clip of 2017 F1 challengers

*show clip of 2017 F1 challengers overlayed with sounds of F1 v10s of the turn of the 21st century.

the sensation of speed is more than just the acceleration. 
yes physics majors speed != acceleration.

*show picture of enzo ferrari

does anyone know who this man is?

founder of the legendary italian manufacturer Scuderia ferrari
Known by the Prancing Stallion
Or fabled donkey.
Ferrari not in it to build electric cars

Like the recycled dinosaurs that these cars run on
the internal combustion engine will too go extinct.

Whenever you see an exotic vehicle and heavily critque its excessiveness 
and waste. Ask them to rev the engine first. 

I welcome our new robot overlords, this change is good for the planet. 
Not so good for petrol heads.

Savor the sound 

And lets remember our fabled donkey
